Oh? You think that's bad?

There's also this gem sitting right next to it.

def silence_warnings
   old_verbose, $VERBOSE = $VERBOSE, nil
   begin
     yield
   ensure
     $VERBOSE = old_verbose
   end
end

So that things like this can be done:

silence_warnings { Customer = Struct.new("Customer", :name) }

instead of doing something simple like:

unless defined? Customer
   Customer = Struct.new "Customer", :name
end
